/**
 * MyRobotControllerAdministration is a container for 'administrative' methods that interact
 * with the Swerve library. You don't <em>have to</em> put your administrative methods in a separate
 * class as we do here, but it does help keep them neat and tidy. Administrative methods are
 * each tagged with a Java annotation that connotes and bestows their significance; see the
 * individual example methods for details. Note that administrative methods don't reside in any
 * given OpMode, but rather are used and invoked outside of the OpMode life cycle.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: if you previously cloned YourCodeHere for your team and per the then-current
 * instructions edited FtcRobotController\build.gradle to mention your project, you should
 * now remove that: FtcRobotController\build.gradle should now always be the original, verbatim
 * version as currently found here. Then, in your own project's build.gradle make necessary
 * changes to match the now-current YourCodeHere\build.gradle. Specifically, ensure that:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>it uses <code>apply plugin: 'com.android.<em>application</em>'</code> not <code>...android.<em>module</em>'</code></li>
 *     <li>its <code>defaultConfig</code> section contains the following</li>
 *         <ol>
 *         <li>the verbatim line <code>applicationId 'com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller'</code></li>
 *         <li>a <code>versionCode</code> line with the version three or greater: <code>versionCode 3</code></li>
 *         </ol>
 *     <li>its <code>dependencies</code> section contains the line <code>compile project(':FtcRobotController')</code></li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>If you're new to us here, these updates have already been done for you.</p>
